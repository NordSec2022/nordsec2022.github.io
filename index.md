### About the Conference

NordSec is an annual research conference series that has been running since 1996. The NordSec conferences address a broad range of topics on IT security. The events bring together security researchers from the Nordic countries, Northern Europe, and beyond. In addition to being a venue for academic publishing, NordSec is an important meeting place for university faculty, students, and industry researchers and experts from the region.

Contributions should reflect original research, developments, studies and experience. Submitted papers should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references and appendices) in [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.

#### Submission Guidelines

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:

* Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.
* Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.
* Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.
* We encourage the inclusion of anonymized digital research artifacts in the form of anonymized download links in the submitted manuscript. Tools like [https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github/](https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github/) could be useful to authors to anonymize links and contents of research artifacts consisting in code repositories.
* Submissions should be formatted using the [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and must not exceed 16 pages (excluding well-marked appendices, and references), with an overall limit of 20 pages. Appendices may be included to assist reviewers who may have questions that fall outside the stated contribution of the paper on which your work is to be evaluated or to provide details that would only be of interest to a small minority of readers. Reviewers are not required to read any appendices so the paper should be self-contained without them. Finally, notice that, according to latest LNCS guidelines, if a paper includes appendices, they should be placed in front of the references.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee listed below.

Papers must be written in English, and submitted online in PDF format, via Easychair, at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nordsec2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nordsec2022).

Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Authors of accepted papers must agree with Springer LNCS copyright and guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference.

##### Airport Transportation

Iceland's international airport (KEF) is at Keflavik, a 40-45 minutes drive from Reykjavik (not to be confused with Reykjavik city airport).

Arrivals

A Flybus operates all day from Keflavik Airport to Reykjavik in connection with all incoming international flights. Tickets can be bought inside the terminal building at the Flybus booth, online, or at a ticket automaton located by the exit door of the terminal building. The Flybus brings passengers to  the BSÍ Bus Station in Reykjavik near the center of town. At the terminal passengers with Flybus Plus tickets board smaller buses which take them to selected hotels and guest houses in Reykjavík. List of hotels and guesthouses with drop-off/pick-up service available can be found here: [www.re.is/flybus/flybusplus](https://www.re.is/flybus/flybusplus).

Departures

The Flybus operates all day in connection with all outgoing flights. Scheduled departures are from the BSÍ Bus Station in Reykjavík. Pick-up service is available from selected hotels and guest houses in Reykjavík for passengers holding Flybus Plus tickets. The day before departure, passengers need to inform the reception desk staff of their hotel/guest house that they want the Flybus to pick them up the following day.

All further Flybus information under [www.re.is/flybus](https://www.re.is/flybus)

Taxi service between Keflavik and Reykjavík is also available, but more expensive.

##### Local Transportation

Reykjavik University is located next to Öskjuhlíð hill, one of Reykjavík's green areas shaped by the Ice Age. Bus line 8 departs at BSI and stops in front of the university (stop HR).  You can buy single trip tickets on the bus for 550 ISK (cash only, no change given), or use the Straeto app (with registered credit card). For more information on local buses, check [http://www.straeto.is/english/](http://www.straeto.is/english/).
